    happened 2-3 times in 30 minutes
    weights with decimals or e could crash it. fixed

Mechanical Improvements:
    newer tubes are slightly thinner so they don't seal as well with the magnet rubber washers
    remove conductivity sensor
    rotate ball valve to not bend up for easier flow
    put flow meter in downward section just before the pummp
    is 2mm actually still too big, can air sneak past
    is 1mm too weak, reinforce by putting it inside of 2mm or 4mm tubing
    decreasing tue size increase pressure on the pump

Mechanical Overhauls:
    swap pan servo with stepper
    swap all tubing with smaller tubing
    remove connectors to reduce air pockets

Too many moving elements seem to cause rendering issues on mobile, reduce flare count
